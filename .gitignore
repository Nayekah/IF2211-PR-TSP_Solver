#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear

*# Ignore the Cargo.lock file in libraries
#  This is a common practice to avoid locking the library to a specific version of its dependencies.
#  If you are developing a library, you should not commit the Cargo.lock file.
#  If you are developing an application, you should commit the Cargo.lock file.
#  See https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-lockfile for more information.
